    "Baymer expects jsons of the following format as as input files:\n",
    "\n",
    "{Context: [A polymorphisms, C polymorphisms, G polymorphisms, T polymorphisms, total contexts, context reference index, list reference index], ...}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the \"context reference index\" is the 0-indexed position of the reference nucleotide in the context and \"list reference index\" is the position in the list of the reference nucleotide. Therefore, for the 3-mer context \"AAA\", the context reference index would be 1 and the list reference index would be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the input json should only contain a single context reference index and sequence context length. In other words, all contexts should be of uniform length (e.g all 3-mers) and should have the same nucleotide in scope (e.g for 3-mers the central nucleotide is the polymorphic nucleotide for all context counts enumerated).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating these files necessitates counting both the contexts and the polymorphism counts. We have provided scripts to count these quantities and format the proper json if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for all of the following tutorial we will be using 5-mer sequence context windows for speed purposes, but the mer length can be designated as desired. The only caveat being that this will necessitate adjusting the buffer on the BED file to accomodate the given sequence context length (described in further detail below)."
